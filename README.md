# Statistical Multivariate Analysis

This is a repository for my functions and codes in MATLAB or Python, during the Statistical Multivariate Analysis class, at Texas Tech University, during Fall 2022. 

During this class, we will be covering topics on Inference, Regression, Classification and Clustering techniques, on high dimensional datasets, imbalanced datasets and datasets with more predictors than samples. This is a Grad Class offered to PhD students on Statistics, Mathematics and Engineering. 

## Initial Information:

At September 4th, we've been covering some concepts on metrics and numerical linear algebra for high dimensional samples. So, the codes for this part will be extremely simple.
